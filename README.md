# Surfs Up
Investing in Waves and Ice Cream using SQL

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy more information about temperature trends, before opening the surf shop. To determine whether the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round, I have provided temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. 

## Results

- The mininum temperature in December is 56 degrees, which is 8 degrees colder than the minimum temperature in June. 
- The average temperature in December is 71 degrees, which is nearly 5 degrees colder than the average temperature in June, at 74.94 degrees.
- The max temperature for December is 83 degrees, while the max temperature for June is 85 degrees, only 2 degrees difference between summer and winter. 

## Summary

While the minimum temperature for December is only 56 degrees, it is really not that bad. Perhaps few people will want ice cream on a 56 degree day, but with the average temperature in December being 71 degrees, it is a comfortable enough temperature that plenty of people will still buy ice cream. Also, being that the maximum temperature in December is a warm 83, only 2 degrees less than the max temperature in June, I conclude that an ice cream shop will survive through the winter, because the temperature differences throughout the most extreme times of year in Oahu are quite mild. 

The first additional query that I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December, would be precipitation, to find whether the amount of rain in December was extreme enough that it would deter potential customers from purchasing ice cream. 

The second additional query that I would perform would be to choose another active station to perform the temperature and precipitation query for, to look for possible alternative or second locations to open up shop.
